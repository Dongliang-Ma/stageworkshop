## Procedure ##

0. Crank some tunes and record the start time!
1. *Browse* to: https://github.com/mlavi/stageworkshop
   - I will submit a pull request shortly to merge my work.
1. *Launch a new terminal*: Change font size for demo, create/change to a new directory.

        git clone https://github.com/mlavi/stageworkshop.git && cd stageworkshop
1. Review HPoC reservation details in rx:

   1. __Browser:__ Copy the cluster External IP, memorize the PE admin password.
   1. __Terminal:__ Create ````example_pocs.txt````, paste the IP, follow with |, the password, and save.
      - *OPTIONAL:* Make a mistake with the octet to show a failure mode.
   1. __Browser:__ Choose the PE URL to show unavailable during foundation process.

1. Side by side: (screens because split desktop doesn't work well enough)

   1. __Browser:__ RX automation: cluster foundation status
   2. __Terminal:__ cut and paste from example_pocs.txt:

          ./stage_workshop.sh -f example_pocs.txt -w 1 #calm

   3. After the automation is uploaded to the cluster CVM, copy and paste the command to monitor the ````stage_calmhow.sh```` progress.

   3. __Browser:__ Reload the PE URL, accept security override, login as admin and password to PE EULA.
   4. __Terminal:__ Once PE UI configured, reload browser to show EULA bypassed or decline EULA.

      - *BUG:* Once Authentication Server is up, you can login as a SSP admin = adminuser05@ntnxlab.local
  5. __Browser:__

      - Show PE Authentication: test above user with the default password.
      - View All Tasks, wait until software is uploading
  6. __Terminal:__ Show that we're waiting...approximately 17 minutes (fast forward)

      - Highlight automation scripts sent to PC

  7. __Browser:__ from PE, show VM table, go to home and show PE registered to PC, launch PC and login as admin.

    * *BUG:* Can't login as a SSP admin = adminuser05@ntnxlab.local
    * Show Authentication, show role mapping, show images.
